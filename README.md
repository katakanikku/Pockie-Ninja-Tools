# Pockie-Ninja-Tools
Tools I use to maintain the SPN servers at stallninja.co.uk and run the Pockie ninja game server

Run in order:
policy.bat -> data01.bat -> gamedb.bat -> game01.bat -> NIOMain.py

Pretty spaghetti code, but i used this project to learn python so a bit of technical debt is present i'd say. Maybe not a good idea to start of with sockets.
